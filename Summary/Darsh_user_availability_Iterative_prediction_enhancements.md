# Availability Prediction Enhancements

## Prompt 1: Additional Data Points for Prediction

**Prompt:**  
*"Based on the current features like Screen_Value, App_Value, and Noise_Value, what additional data points could improve the prediction of user availability?"*  

ChatGPT suggested several additional data points to enhance availability prediction:

- **Motion & Activity:** Use accelerometer/gyroscope and activity recognition (e.g., walking, driving) to infer engagement.  
- **Location & Context:** Incorporate GPS, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth proximity, and local time for situational awareness.  
- **Device States:** Add battery level, charging status, ringer mode, and Do Not Disturb settings.  
- **Interaction Patterns:** Track notification read times and recent unlocks for recency of use.  
- **Calendar/Schedule:** Integrate events and work/personal hours to detect busy periods.  
- **Sleep Tracking:** Use sleep schedules or bedtime mode to identify low-availability times.  
- **Environmental Signals:** Analyze microphone activity, proximity sensor, and headphone use.  
- **Behavioral Trends:** Leverage historical patterns and user feedback for personalization.  

These can be combined with existing features for a richer context-aware model.

## Prompt 2: Inferring Availability Without Attend_time

**Prompt:**  
*"If most Attend_time values are missing, how can I infer availability labels from other columns like Responses or timeSinceLastMessageSession?"*  

ChatGPT outlined a strategy to infer availability without Attend_time:

- **Responses Text:** Parse phrases (e.g., “not been checking” → Unavailable) using rule-based classification.  
- **timeSinceLastMessageSession:** Apply thresholds (e.g., <10 min → Likely Available, >60 min → Likely Unavailable).  
- **Pseudo-Attend_time:** Estimate response time from notification and next interaction timestamps.  
- **Combined Signals:** Blend text clues, time intervals, and device states (e.g., screen status) for robust labels.  
- **Machine Learning:** Train on available Attend_time data using text, time, and context features to predict missing labels.
