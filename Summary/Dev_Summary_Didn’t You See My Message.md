Summary of Didnâ€™t You See My Message? Predicting Attentiveness to Mobile Instant Messages

This research paper explores the feasibility of predicting whether a user will read an instant message within a few minutes or not. The study critiques the common practice of using "last-seen" timestamps as an indicator of availability, highlighting its social pressure and privacy concerns.

The authors conducted a study where they collected behavioural data from 24 participants over a course of two weeks. Based on this data and using machine learning, the researchers identified seven smartphone features such as screen activity, notification interactions, proximity sensor data and ringer mode, as strong indicator of attentiveness. Their predictive model achieved 70.6% accuracy and 81.2% precision in determining if a user would view a message quickly. Further, a survey of 84 participants indicated that people value attentiveness prediction over "last-seen" indicators but worry about false expectations and privacy.

In conclusion, the study proposes a privacy-conscious, automated attentiveness predictor as an alternative to "last-seen" indicators, potentially improving user experience in mobile messaging. Future work includes longitudinal studies to assess real-world impact.
