Summary for "My Phone and Me: Understanding People's Receptivity to Mobile Notifications" Research Paper

This research describes user receptivity to mobile notifications by framing it as a problem of adaptive messaging, which is very similar and aligns closely with attentive messaging systems. The "My Phone and Me" study uses a context-aware approach to understand how various factors influence a user's willingness to engage with notifications at different times. By collecting objective data that includes notification interaction times, and subjective data, such as user-reported disruption and context in a real-world environment, the research paper aims to model and predict opportune moments for delivering notifications by mirroring the adaptive modeling approach.

The main topics discussed in this paper are:

 1. Notification Alert Perception
- Mobile phone users are usually aware of notifications even when the phone is in silent mode (85.37% noticed).
- Vibration mode on mobile devices leads to the fastest awareness (84.62% noticed).
- Sound-only mode (76.25% noticed) and sound with vibrate (78.95% noticed) were less effective than silent or vibrate-only modes.

 2. Factors that Influence Seen Time
- Alert Modality: Vibrate-only notifications on mobile devices were seen fastest (avg. 3m 21s), followed by sound with vibrate (4m 50s), sound-only (5m 57s), and silent (7m 33s).
- Ongoing Task: Notifications on mobile devices were seen fastest during communication tasks (avg. 47s) and slowest when users were idle (9m 30s).
- Task Complexity: Tasks that were more complex correlated with faster seen times, possibly due to increased alertness.

 3. Factors Influencing Decision Time
- Sender-Recipient Relationship: Notifications from partners were handled fastest (avg. 3.3s), followed by immediate family (4.9s). Extended family and service providers had the longest decision times (11.9s and 8.1s, respectively).
- Notification Priority: High-priority (foreground) notifications received quicker responses (avg. 11.9s) compared to low-priority ones (25.9s).

 4. Perceived Disruption
- Task Complexity: Strong positive correlation between task complexity and perceived disruption.
- Task Completion Level: Notifications were most disruptive when users were in the middle of or finishing a task, least disruptive when starting a task or idle.
- Sender Type: Messages from subordinates at work and system messages were most disruptive, while those from extended family were least disruptive.

 5. Personality Influence
- Extroverts reported higher levels of perceived disruption.
- Extroversion, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism significantly influenced seen time.
- Extroversion and Neuroticism significantly influenced decision time.
