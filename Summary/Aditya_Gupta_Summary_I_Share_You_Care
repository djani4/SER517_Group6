**Summary -I Share, You Care: Private Status Sharing and Sender-Controlled Notifications in Mobile Instant Messaging**

This research paper addresses the challenges of interruptions and privacy concerns in
Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) by proposing two novel design concepts: private status
sharing and sender-controlled notifications. These concepts aim to enhance social
awareness and reduce unnecessary disruptions in MIM communications.
Key Issues in Current MIM Systems:
• MIM notifications often disrupt users, especially during attention-demanding tasks.
• Existing systems lack mechanisms for senders to control notifications, leading to
untimely interruptions.
• Availability indicators (e.g., read receipts, last seen) are often inaccurate and can
create privacy concerns, social pressure, and feelings of being surveilled.
Proposed Solutions
1. Private Status Sharing:
• Allows users to share custom statuses (e.g., "busy working") with selected
partners.
• Statuses are personal (shared only with chosen contacts), customizable
(manually set), and reactive (displayed only when a partner sends a message).
• This approach reduces privacy concerns and social pressure by providing
context for unavailability without continuous disclosure.
2. Sender-Controlled Notifications:
• Enables senders to decide whether to alert the receiver immediately (Alert Now)
or send the message without a notification (Don’t Alert).
• Senders consider factors like the receiver’s status, message urgency, and their
own availability when making this decision.
• This feature reduces interruptions by involving senders in the notification
decision process.
Implementation and Evaluation
• The researchers developed MyButler, an Android app prototype that integrates these
concepts with KakaoTalk, a popular MIM app in Korea.
• A two-week field study with 11 pairs of frequent KakaoTalk users revealed:
o Private status sharing was primarily used to share real-time activities, explain
unavailability, and reduce the expectation of immediate responses.
o Sender-controlled notifications were used to avoid interrupting receivers,
hide messages from others, and manage the sender’s own availability.
Key Contributions
1. Private status sharing helps relieve social pressure and provides a privacypreserving way to share contextual information.
2. Sender-controlled notifications offer a novel approach to reducing interruptions by
involving senders in the notification process.
3. The study highlights the potential for these features to improve MIM communication
by fostering considerate and intimate interactions.
Design Rationale
• Private Status Sharing: Focuses on personalization, customization, and reactive
disclosure to address privacy and usability concerns.
• Sender-Controlled Notifications: Emphasizes unobtrusive and easy-to-use
interfaces to minimize user burden while providing meaningful control over
notifications.
Technical Implementation
• MyButler leverages Android’s NotificationListenerService and Firebase for real-time
communication between sender and receiver apps.
• It mutes KakaoTalk notifications and manages them based on the sender’s chosen
notification option.
Conclusion:
The study demonstrates that private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications can
significantly improve MIM experiences by reducing interruptions, enhancing privacy, and
fostering more considerate communication. These findings offer valuable insights for
designing future MIM systems that prioritize user well-being and social awareness.
