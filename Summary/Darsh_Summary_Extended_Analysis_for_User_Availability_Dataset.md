# Summary of the Extended Analysis for User Availability Dataset

The dataset provided by the professor was further analyzed to enhance the predictive capabilities of ChatGPT for determining user availability. The analysis aimed at uncovering patterns in user behavior and establishing a structured approach to categorize availability based on contextual factors.

## Key Areas of Extended Analysis:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Conducted a thorough investigation of the dataset’s structure, identifying relevant features such as:
  - **DayOfWeek:** To examine daily usage patterns.
  - **HourOfDay:** To observe how user availability varies throughout the day.
  - **Responses:** To evaluate textual descriptions of user context (e.g., “phone is on vibrate mode,” “phone is in a noisy environment”).
- Generated visual representations (e.g., heatmaps, line graphs) to detect correlations between time, context, and user availability.

### Feature Extraction and Contextual Structuring:
- Important contextual factors were identified, including:
  - **Ringer Mode:** To determine if the user’s phone is on silent, vibrate, or normal mode.
  - **Notification Interaction:** To assess if the user is actively responding to notifications.
  - **Environmental Noise:** To evaluate if background noise impacts the user’s availability.
  - **Phone Usage Trends:** To detect patterns indicating active or idle states of the user.
- Structured data was formatted to enhance compatibility with ChatGPT’s input processing mechanism.

### Rule-Based Categorization:
- Developed a set of rules and heuristics to classify user availability based on:
  - **Device Usage Frequency:** Frequent interaction indicates potential availability.
  - **Response Time Patterns:** Delayed responses may indicate unavailability.
  - **Notification Checking:** Lack of notification checking suggests possible unavailability.
- Rules were designed to establish a baseline comparison for evaluating ChatGPT’s predictions.

### Scenario-Based Evaluation:
- Created multiple real-world scenarios from the dataset, including:
  - Phone in a noisy environment.
  - Phone on vibrate mode during meetings.
  - Phone left idle for extended periods.
- These scenarios were used to test ChatGPT’s response accuracy by providing structured inputs derived from the dataset.

### Improving Dataset Compatibility with ChatGPT:
- Refined prompts and structured inputs to enhance ChatGPT’s interpretation of user availability.
- Compared ChatGPT’s predictions with pre-established rules to measure accuracy and consistency.

### Feedback Loop Integration:
- Initiated the process of implementing a feedback loop where ChatGPT’s predictions are reviewed and refined based on comparison with the dataset’s rules.
- Documented inconsistencies and suggested improvements to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Findings:
The extended analysis provided insights into how various contextual factors influence user availability. By categorizing user availability based on ringer mode, notification interactions, environmental noise, and phone usage patterns, a baseline prediction model was established. This model now serves as a benchmark for evaluating ChatGPT’s ability to interpret structured data effectively.
