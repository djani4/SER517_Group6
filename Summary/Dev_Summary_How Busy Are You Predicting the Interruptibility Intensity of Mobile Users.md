Summary of How Busy Are You Predicting the Interruptibility Intensity of Mobile Users

This research paper explores a method to predict the interruptibility of mobile users. The study introduces a two-stage hierachical model to predict how interruptible users are rather than classifying them in a binary manner i.e., interruptible or not. The two-stage model is divided in the way that the first stage predicts whether a user will react to an interruption and the second stage assesses the intensity of their interruptibility based on context and tasks are engaged in.

This user study uniquely integrates the Big Five personality traits into the model, improving prediction accuracy. For users with no prior data, predictions are bootstrapped using data from users with similar personality traits.

The authors collected over 500 interruptibility records from 22 participants over four weeks. The model achieved an accuracy of 66.1% for predicting interruptibility intensity and 75% accuracy in predicting whether a user would react to an interruption.

Based on the data collected and the accuracy of the model, the authors arrived at the key findings that people are more interruptible in a pleasant mood and when engaged in shorter tasks. Another major finding was that location matters. Users are least interruptible at shopping places and most interruptible at entertainment venues. Lastly, social relationships influence interruptibility i.e., users were more likely to respond to interruptions from family and close acquaintances than from strangers.

In conclusion, the model can be used for smartphone notification management, prioritizing notifications based on a user's availability and enagement. It highlights the potential of personality-based machine learning models to optimize human-computer interaction.
