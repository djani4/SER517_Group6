**Summary -Intelligent Personal Assistants â€“
A Systematic Literature Review**

This paper presents a systematic literature review of Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs),
such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri, which enable hands-free humandevice interaction through Natural Language User Interfaces (NLUI). IPAs leverage
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), speech recognition, and natural language
processing to perform tasks like scheduling, information retrieval, and health monitoring.
The study aims to fill a gap in existing research by providing a comprehensive review of IPA
technologies, applications, challenges, and future opportunities.
The review identifies five key contributions: (1) a systematic review of IPA state-of-the-art,
(2) a taxonomy for classifying IPA characteristics, (3) a mapping of IPA usage domains, (4)
areas of opportunity for IPA applications, and (5) an overview of commercial and noncommercial IPA systems. The paper highlights challenges related to usability, security, and
privacy, which are critical for future research.
The methodology follows a structured systematic review process, including planning,
research question formulation, data collection from databases like ACM Digital Library and
IEEE Xplore, and application of inclusion/exclusion criteria to filter relevant studies. The
review focuses on articles published after 2012, ensuring relevance to current
advancements. Quality assessment criteria were applied to evaluate the selected studies,
ensuring methodological rigor.
The paper concludes by discussing limitations, open questions, and future research
directions, emphasizing the need for improved usability, security, and domain-specific
applications of IPAs. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and
practitioners in AI, HCI, and related fields.
