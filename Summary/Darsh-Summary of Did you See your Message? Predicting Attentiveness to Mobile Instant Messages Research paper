Summary of Did you See your Message? Predicting Attentiveness to Mobile Instant Messages Research paper

Problem: 
Mobile instant messaging (MIM) comes with an expectation of high attentiveness, creating social pressure and privacy concerns due to features like "last seen" indicators. 
These indicators are weak predictors of actual attentiveness.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a machine-computed prediction of whether a user will view a message within a few minutes, shared as an attentiveness indicator.

Methodology:
•	A survey was conducted to understand user perceptions of sharing availability/attentiveness.
•	Seventeen potential features were extracted from the collected sensor data, encompassing user activity (screen interaction, phone handling), recent notification activity (number of pending notifications), 
  phone state (ringer mode, in pocket), and context (hour of day, day of week).
•	Behavioral data was collected from 24 Android users for two weeks, recording phone usage and message notification data.
•	Machine learning techniques were used to identify features that predict attentiveness.

Results:
•	Seven features (time since last screen on, time since last notification viewed, hour of the day, etc.) can predict attentiveness with 70.6% accuracy and 81.2% precision for fast reactions.
•	In comparison, a model based simply on WhatsApp's "last seen" status achieved just 58.8% accuracy and 53.7% precision in predicting high attention, revealing its insufficiency as an attentiveness predictor.
•	WhatsApp's "last seen" status was found to be a poor predictor of attentiveness.

Key Implications:
•	The methods stated in the research paper demonstrate the feasibility of predicting attentiveness to mobile messages.
•	It highlights the importance of expectation management, reducing social pressure, and preserving privacy in MIM design.
•	The authors suggest design considerations for implementing attentiveness prediction, including clear communication of estimates and allowing for "plausible deniability."
