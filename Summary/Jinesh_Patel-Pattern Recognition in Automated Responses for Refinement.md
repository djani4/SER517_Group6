Summary of Pattern Recognition in Automated Responses for Refinement 

This document summarizes key findings from analyzing patterns in the dataset to determine trends that GPT can effectively interpret.
User Availability Indicators – Factors such as ringer mode, notification interactions, and screen activity play a role in predicting response likelihood. GPT can utilize these signals to assess availability.
Time-Based Patterns – Users exhibit distinct response behaviors at different times of the day. Incorporating temporal data can enhance GPT's ability to predict response patterns.
Usage Trends & Contextual Cues – Frequency and duration of device usage correlate with responsiveness. Users who frequently engage with their devices tend to respond more promptly.
Inconsistencies in Response Patterns – Some data entries contain conflicting signals (e.g., receiving multiple notifications but not responding), indicating the need for additional context in interpretation.
Enhancing GPT’s Interpretability – Structuring data more effectively and refining prompt engineering can improve GPT’s ability to differentiate between active and passive availability states.
These insights help in refining data structuring and prompt design to extract more meaningful automated responses from GPT.
