**Potential Enhancements for ChatGPT Response Analysis:**

1. **Advanced Feedback Loop Mechanisms:**
   - Implement a dynamic feedback system where incorrect predictions are immediately flagged and used for retraining.
   - Introduce a confidence scoring system to indicate the certainty of ChatGPT's predictions.
   - Adjust prompts in real-time to refine accuracy when low-confidence responses are detected.

2. **Enhanced Context Understanding through Multi-Modal Inputs:**
   - Simultaneously incorporate multiple contextual signals (e.g., combining ringer mode and environmental noise).
   - Develop a mechanism for ChatGPT to analyze temporal patterns in user behavior (e.g., frequent short bursts of phone use vs. prolonged inactivity).

3. **Refined Prompt Engineering:**
   - Use structured prompts that clearly outline all relevant contextual factors (e.g., “User is in a noisy environment with phone on vibrate mode at 9 PM. Is the user likely available?”).
   - Design hierarchical prompts that progressively refine predictions by asking more detailed questions (e.g., availability, reason for unavailability, likelihood of response).
