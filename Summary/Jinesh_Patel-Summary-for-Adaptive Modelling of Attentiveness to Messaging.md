Summary for Adaptive Modelling of Attentiveness to Messaging: A Hybrid Approach

In this paper, the authors tackle a common issue many users face—being unable to respond to mobile messages immediately, which can sometimes lead to social misunderstandings. The study proposes a prediction model designed to determine when a user might be inattentive to incoming messages. This is important because quick replies are often expected, and delays can create unwanted pressure.

To solve this, the paper introduces a hybrid weighted model. Instead of relying on a single prediction method, the model combines three approaches. The first is a general model that captures overall messaging patterns across all users. The second is a group-based model that classifies users into clusters based on their similar phone usage habits. The third is a personalized model that learns from an individual’s own past behavior. One of the main challenges highlighted is the “cold-start” problem—new users often don’t have enough data for a personalized model to work well. The hybrid approach cleverly starts with general and group-based predictions, and as more data is gathered, it gradually gives more importance to the personalized model.

The evaluation is based on an extensive dataset, including over 1.3 million messaging notifications collected from 274 users over a period of three weeks. The researchers examined various features such as screen activity, how often and when the phone is used, location, and the timing of interactions. They initially considered grouping users by demographics like age and gender but found that grouping by actual usage behavior led to better results.

Overall, the paper shows that by dynamically adjusting the influence of each model type, it’s possible to improve the accuracy of predicting when a user might miss a message. This adaptive strategy not only addresses the cold-start problem but also adjusts to changes in user behavior over time. The work provides a promising foundation for building smarter, context-aware messaging systems that can help ease the pressure of immediate response expectations.
