Summary of Responsiveness in Instant Messaging: Predictive Models Supporting Inter-Personal Communication

In this research paper, the authors Daniel Avrahami and Scott E. Hudson explore the predictive models for determining how likely a user is to respond to an Instant Message (IM) in a specific time interval. While laying the foundation for the research paper in the problem statement the researchers found the Instant Messaging is widely popular in both personal and work-related communications. The traditional IM systems did not have effective awareness indicators and resulted in messages arriving in inconvenient times and interuptions from IM disrupted the workflow or even left the sender waiting for a response, overall affecting one's productivity.

The objective of this research was to develop statistical models that predict responsiveness that is the likelihood of a user will respond to an IM within the set time intervals which were set to 30 seconds, 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes. Using these models can be used to enhace online status indicators and optimize communication timing. 

The researchers performed a study where they observed 16 participants, collecting over 90,000 messages using the Trillian Pro IM client. The data included message timings, user activity i.e. keyboard/mouse usage and desktop events. All of this data collection was done keeping in mind privacy measures such as anonymizing message content.

The key findings from this user study and the performance of the predictive model created based on the collected data was extensively analyzed where the authors found the model achieved up to 90.1% accuracy in predicting response times. In addition to that, the responsiveness was highly correlated with user activity, status indicators and time since the last message. Lastly, under the assumption of not considering buddy-specific information, User-centric models performed just as well as full models.

The applications of this research could be adjusting online status dynamically, showing more accurate availability indicators and filtering notifications to reduce interruptions. However, maintaining plausible deniability is crucial as users might not always want their availability explicitly known. 

Although, this research was successful in predicting response times there were a few shortcomings in the model prediction such as the models were unable to analyze message content and investigating responsiveness as a continuous measure rather than fixed intervals. Overcoming these limitations could improve the predictions even more and future work could also include expanding beyond desktop events and including external sensors like speech or door activity.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that statistical models can effectively predict IM responsiveness, offering potential improvements for communication tools. Future research could refine these models to better capture availability, integrating factors like message content and real-world context.
