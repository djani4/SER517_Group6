# Transition to design of the application

The focus shifted from prompt validation and hallucination analysis to the architectural and design phase of a simulator app intended to interact with the ChatGPT API. The goal was to lay the foundation for a tool that processes user context data row by row from a CSV file and dynamically feeds it into ChatGPT to generate predictions about availability.

## Key Functionality

The app's core functionality was clearly defined:

- **Button 1**: Opens a CSV, selects a row at random, formats it into a prompt, and sends it to ChatGPT to display the response.
- **Button 2**: Proposed feature for manual prompt testing or toggling between raw and formatted data inputs flexible based on future needs.

## UI and Design Work

To support development, UI design was initiated using tools like **Figma** and flowchart diagrams.

### Flowcharts Created

1. **Flow Diagram for Button 1**: Illustrates the process from CSV selection to prompt generation and response display.
2. **Flow Diagram for Prompt Customization**: Outlines the logic for prompt customization and user interaction with the interface.

## User Stories

Three user stories were defined, each supported by four actionable tasks. These stories helped to:

- Scope the design of the interface.
- Simulate CSV data interactions.
- Prepare the flow needed for API integration.
